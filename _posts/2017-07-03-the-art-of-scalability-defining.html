<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This is a continuation of my previous post -&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/63N6Wg" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/63N6Wg</a>&nbsp;on attempting to define microservices.<br /><br />As I mentioned in earlier post, the monolithic way of scaling is helpful but not quite. It could be further strengthened by designing the application as a collection of microservices that talk to each other (and that perform each individual business function) as individual applications do as opposed to a monolithic application. Thus functionally decomposing the application into multiple mini-applications (services).<br /><br />Now, each particular application (services) can be scaled along X-axis and Z-axis again for scalability and availability. Scalability and availability make more sense when you apply it after decomposing it into multiple applications.<br /><br />References:<br /><a href="https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/the-art-of-scale-microservices-the-scale-cube-and-load-balancing">https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/the-art-of-scale-microservices-the-scale-cube-and-load-balancing</a><br /><a href="http://microservices.io/articles/scalecube.html">http://microservices.io/articles/scalecube.html</a><br /><a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/microservices-at-netflix-architectural-best-practices/">https://www.nginx.com/blog/microservices-at-netflix-architectural-best-practices/</a><br /><a href="http://philcalcado.com/2015/09/08/how_we_ended_up_with_microservices.html">http://philcalcado.com/2015/09/08/how_we_ended_up_with_microservices.html</a><br /><a href="https://eng.uber.com/building-tincup/">https://eng.uber.com/building-tincup/</a><br /><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/12/1/deep-lessons-from-google-and-ebay-on-building-ecosystems-of.html">http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/12/1/deep-lessons-from-google-and-ebay-on-building-ecosystems-of.html</a><br /><br /></div>
