<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">An article came in a leading website dedicated to betterment of Data - <a href="https://upside.tdwi.org/articles/2016/09/20/Already-Failed-at-Big-Data.aspx?utm_source=nl&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=nl45&amp;share=" target="_blank">UPSIDE.com</a> wherein a mention of an email received is reproduced here:</span></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><i style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: black; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">As part of a larger mandate handed down from our board, we launched a big data initiative. We secured a Hadoop distribution, signed on to several open source projects, modernized our analytics, and created a big data team to start loading data.</i></div><i style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: black; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"></i><br /><div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><i style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: black; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><br /></i></div><i style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: black; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"></i><br /><div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><i style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: black; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">As the project manager, I can tell you that we have all worked very diligently and for many hours to make our big data platform work. My teammates and I started the data warehouse project here 15 years ago. We have learned a lot since then, and we all consider ourselves big data experts.</i></div><i style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: black; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"></i><div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><i style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: black; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><br /></i></div><i style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: black; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><div style="box-sizing: border-box;">However, things have slowed down. We continue to load different types of data (including point of sale, customer profile, Web logs, and supplier data) and we've actually discussed using the platform to tie together data that had never been integrated.</div><div style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br /></div><div style="box-sizing: border-box;">I'm hearing some hallway chatter about the project being "in the weeds." I think my colleagues are beginning to lose faith in me and my team. What should we have done? More important, what should we do now?</div></i></blockquote><div style="box-sizing: border-box; text-align: left;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: black; font-family: &quot;open sans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Here are my views on this topic. As always, these are my views and my views alone.

So, with anything that has a lot of interest around, there will be efforts that may be enthusiasm without well-defined objectives that may bring projects to existence too soon. </span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"></span><br /><div style="box-sizing: border-box; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;">Now that we have said that, let us begin looking at some of the&nbsp;things that could have been done:</span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"></span><br /><div style="box-sizing: border-box; text-align: left;"><ol><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><li>Identify a strategic goal, get your sponsors- Every project needs sponsors. Keeping them motivated is one of the most important things a PM should do. The strongest motivation for the sponsors of a project is a strategic goal. For an initiative that is as intensive as an analytics project, you need to identify the goal and the motivation. If not, it just gets lost.&nbsp;Any project without strong and committed sponsor and motivated stakeholders is bound to get lost in its way.</li><li>Work breakdown and execution - Now that you have identified the strategic objectives, Break your objectives into actionable tasks and group them into small controlled projects and execute the projects in a proper sequence. You need to get the team to try and focus on the project at hand. When it comes to focusing on the bigger picture, have a steering committee and get them to focus on that.</li><li>Stay focused and keep communicating (and keep your sponsors close) - The team has to stay focused on the project at hand and keep delivering incremental and actionable chunks of work. As a project manager, you need to focus on&nbsp; communicating the success story. Any delivery without a strong success story is just a science project or experiment. All success stories should be documented and communicated.</li><li>Know what's next - While your team is focused on your current task, it is important to know what is next and it is on the PM and steering committee to focus on that. Keep up with the changes to organizational objectives. Keep sharing your expenditure and formalize your ways/means to determine ROI for each request processed.</li><li>Do retrospective - in addition to every sprint, do periodic retrospectives for strategic objectives/goals (which could be your epics).</li></span></ol></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"></span><div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot;;"><div>Now coming back to what you need to do to get out of the situation, here are some pointers of things I would do if I was in this situation:</div><ol><li>Identify and explore possible use cases for your current and past deliverables. Convert these use cases into before-after stories. You can either convert these stories into videos and publish them into your intranet with a link to send emails to your steering committee distribution-list or conduct a series of brownbag sessions (or pizza driven development). For more details on how to conduct&nbsp;a brownbag session, refer this link: https://proessler.wordpress.com/2014/09/07/how-to-set-off-a-brown-bag-session-in-your-company-in-60-minutes/. These will help drive interest back and usability back.</li><li>Conduct an ideation session and get ideas within the team on how best to get better adoption. Any product without adoption isn't going to stick around for long.</li><li>Now that you have enough to act upon, prioritize, plan and implement by closely working with your stakeholders.</li><li>Deliver some data products(like dashboards, some predictions etc., even if not originally planned for) to show examples of how data could be used to underline the importance and repeat the brownbag sessions to showcase them</li></ol><div>These are my thoughts. What do you think? Please feel free to comment here.</div><div><br /></div></span><br /><div><i style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: black; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><br /></i></div></div>
