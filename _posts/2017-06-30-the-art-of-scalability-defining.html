Each of the methods of scaling has its own advantages and drawbacks.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Scaling by X axis is more traditional model of scaling wherein we deploy multiple pieces of infrastructure running the same application behind a load-balancer to help manage load.</div><div><br /></div><div>The other way of scaling is by Z axis where in you basically partition your requests with a little more intelligence into different buckets of either users or groups (basically some partitioning) to direct requests that either app level or DB level to go and sit in different instances of the same application/partitions of the same database.</div><div><br /></div><div>Both X-axis and Z-axis partitioning rely on deploying the entire application (monolith) several times.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, when we look at Y-axis model, the one that attracted a lot of attention, it is basically slicing up the application monolith into small individually/independently deploy-able applications that serve a specific business process. This approach of leveraging "Y-axis" scaling is fondly referred to as "micro-services".&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Some alternate definitions that focus on micro in micro-services exist but are potentially resulting in misalignment, if you ask me :)</div></div>
