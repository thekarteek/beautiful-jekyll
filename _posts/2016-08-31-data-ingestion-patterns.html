<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Data acquisition is one of the most crucial aspects of the data ecosystem and can turn painful if not appropriately dealt with. Therefore, I wanted to outline some of the standard ingestion patterns in play and provide visibility:<br /><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Batch Ingestion pattern - where the data is batched and ingested</li><li>Lambda Ingestion pattern - where the data is considered both as a batch and a stream and handled separately by batch and speed layers and served together by providing views on each of the layers.</li><li>Kappa Ingestion pattern - where the data is considered as a stream and ingested as a stream.</li></ol><div>I will go into details with examples in subsequent posts.</div></div>
